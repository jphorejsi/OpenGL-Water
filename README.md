This project aimed to deepen my understanding of OpenGL and the graphics pipeline by creating a realistic water rendering technique. I began by placing a flat-shaded quad to represent a water surface, using it as the base vertex buffer object. Two framebuffer textures were created for reflection and refraction, which were sent to the fragment shader. For the reflection effect, I modified the camera's position and inverted its pitch to capture the mirrored scene, using clipping planes to discard unnecessary objects. Projective texture mapping ensured the textures aligned correctly with the water surface, creating a realistic visual output.

To further enhance realism, I implemented a DuDv map to introduce dynamic water movement by distorting the U and V texture coordinates. This map simulated the natural undulation and flow of water by scrolling over time, creating a rippling effect. The DuDv map allowed the water to appear alive and in constant motion, capturing the subtle surface details of real water.

To improve the blending of reflection and refraction, I utilized the Fresnel effect, which dynamically adjusts the blend ratio based on the viewer's angle relative to the water surface. This mimics the way light interacts with water, resulting in a more natural appearance. Additionally, a normal map was incorporated, synchronized with the DuDv map, to simulate realistic lighting interactions on the water surface, enabling dynamic lighting calculations that responded to the water's motion.

Finally, I added soft edges to the water simulation to create a natural transition between the water surface and its surroundings. By using the depth buffer, I adjusted the water's transparency based on its proximity to other objects, creating a seamless blend. This technique enhanced realism by mimicking the natural behavior of water edges, making the water appear more integrated with the environment.
